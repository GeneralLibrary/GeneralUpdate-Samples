### Definition

Namespace: GeneralUpdate.ClientCore.Hubs

Assembly: GeneralUpdate.ClientCore.dll



The `UpgradeHubService` is a mechanism based on SignalR for pushing updated version information. It supports both one-to-one and one-to-many push notifications.

```c#
public class UpgradeHubService : IUpgradeHubService
```

NuGet Installation

```shell
NuGet\Install-Package GeneralUpdate.ClientCore -Version 9.1.2
```

### Example

The following example defines methods that include the use of `VersionHub`.

```c#
//1. General usage
var hub = new UpgradeHubService("http://localhost:5000/UpgradeHub"
                , null,"dfeb5833-975e-4afb-88f1-6278ee9aeff6");
    hub.AddListenerReceive((message) =>
    {
        // The message is currently limited to a JSON string of the Packet object
        Debug.WriteLine(message);
    });
await hub.StartAsync();

//2. In projects with dependency injection capability, you can also use dependency injection, for example: Prism
protected override void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry)
{
    // Register Services
    containerRegistry.Register<IUpgradeHubService, UpgradeHubService>();
}

public MainWindowViewModel(IUpgradeHubService service) 
{
    service.StartAsync();
    //...
}
```
