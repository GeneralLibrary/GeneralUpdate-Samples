## 2. What does GeneralUpdate offer?

##### Component Features

| Feature                    | Supported      | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resume Download            | Yes            | If an update fails, it will resume downloading the update package the next time it starts. (Effective by default when the component is referenced) |
| Version-by-Version Update  | Yes            | If the current client version is multiple versions behind the server, it will update one by one based on the release dates of the versions. (Effective by default when the component is referenced) |
| Binary Differential Update | Yes            | Generates patch files by comparing new and old versions using differential algorithms. (Effective by default when the component is referenced) |
| Incremental Update         | Yes            | Updates only the files that have changed compared to the previous version and deletes files that do not exist in the current version. (Effective by default when the component is referenced) |
| Forced Update              | Yes            | Forces an update directly after opening the client.          |
| Multi-Branch Update        | Yes            | Supports updating different content based on different branches of a product. |
| Latest Version Push        | Yes            | Implemented based on Signal R to push the latest version.    |
| Multi-Language             | To be verified | Can also be written as a console program to act as an update "script" for applications in other languages. |
| Skip Update                | Yes            | Supports injecting a pop-up to let users decide whether to update this release; forced updates from the server side will override this. |

| OSS                        | Yes            | Simplifies updates with an independent update mechanism. Only requires placing a `version.json` configuration file on the file server. The component will update and download based on the version information in the configuration file. |

| Custom Method List         | Yes            | Injects a collection of custom methods that execute before the update starts. If any exception occurs while executing the custom method list, it will be notified through exception subscription. (Recommended to check the current software environment before updating) |

## 5. Unified Language

![](D:\github_project\GeneralUpdate-Samples\website\i18n\en\docusaurus-plugin-content-docs\current\docs\doc\imgs\client_server_upgrade.jpg)

Before starting to use GeneralUpdate, we need to understand some basic concepts in the system. Please download the GeneralUpdate-Samples repository and navigate to the `..\GeneralUpdate-Samples\src` directory for better understanding.

| Name                | Description                                                  | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client              | The client being updated.                                    | If you want to update QQ, then QQ is the Client.             |
| Upgrade             | The upgrade program is an independent process. It should be placed in the same directory as the Client and should not be associated with any business or design during use (or coding); it must remain independently referenced. | QQ cannot update its own files during runtime, so the Upgrade handles this task. |
| Packet              | Update Patch Package                                         | Gamers often hear the concept of "patches," which are used to update vulnerabilities or content in a game. Similarly, here the update patch package contains files with content differences or new files from the old and new versions, and files that need to be deleted. |
| Server              | Server Application                                           | Manages version update information, patch packages, and version verification. (In the Samples, only a simple example is provided and does not fulfill these functions; developers need to implement this themselves or purchase the GeneralSpacestation service). |
| GeneralUpdate.Tools | Update Patch Creation Tool                                   | A packaging tool provided by this open-source project for generating update patch packages (.zip file format). |
